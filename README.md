# PigGame
This project was for learning purpose. Basically I wanted to gain more knowledge about <b>Javascript, CSS and HTML</b> so in this game there are two players were in each of them roles the dice on button click and his score increments by the amount of the dice rolled.
If the dice rolled is 1 then the next player has to roll. The score is updated according to the dice rolled by each player. The player who gets 100 points wins the game. <br>
